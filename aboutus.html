      <h1>About Us </h1>
      <h2>Learn how we got started.</h2>


      <p>Having uttered these words with a cool, careless air, the detective took leave of the consul, and repaired to the telegraph office, whence he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the London police office.  A quarter of an hour later found Fix, with a small bag in his hand, proceeding on board the Mongolia; and, ere many moments longer, the noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the Red Sea.</p>

<p>The distance between Suez and Aden is precisely thirteen hundred and ten miles, and the regulations of the company allow the steamers one hundred and thirty-eight hours in which to traverse it.  The Mongolia, thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer, seemed likely, so rapid was her speed, to reach her destination considerably within that time.  The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi were bound for India some for Bombay, others for Calcutta by way of Bombay, the nearest route thither, now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula. Among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of various grades, the latter being either attached to the regular British forces or commanding the Sepoy troops, and receiving high salaries ever since the central government has assumed the powers of the East India Company: for the sub-lieutenants get 280 pounds, brigadiers, 2,400 pounds, and generals of divisions, 4,000 pounds.  What with the military men, a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels, and the hospitable efforts of the purser, the time passed quickly on the Mongolia.  The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the eight o'clock supper, and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day; and the hours were whirled away, when the sea was tranquil, with music, dancing, and games.</p>

<p>But the Red Sea is full of caprice, and often boisterous, like most long and narrow gulfs.  When the wind came from the African or Asian coast the Mongolia, with her long hull, rolled fearfully.  Then the ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos were silent; singing and dancing suddenly ceased.  Yet the good ship ploughed straight on, unretarded by wind or wave, towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.  What was Phileas Fogg doing all this time?  It might be thought that, in his anxiety, he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind, the disorderly raging of the billows&mdash;every chance, in short, which might force the Mongolia to slacken her speed, and thus interrupt his journey.  But, if he thought of these possibilities, he did not betray the fact by any outward sign.</p>

<p>Always the same impassible member of the Reform Club, whom no incident could surprise, as unvarying as the ship's chronometers, and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck, he passed through the memorable scenes of the Red Sea with cold indifference; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which, along its borders, raised their picturesque outlines against the sky; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the Arabic Gulf, which the old historians always spoke of with horror, and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices.  How did this eccentric personage pass his time on the Mongolia?  He made his four hearty meals every day, regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer; and he played whist indefatigably, for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself.  A tax-collector, on the way to his post at Goa; the Rev. Decimus Smith, returning to his parish at Bombay; and a brigadier-general of the English army, who was about to rejoin his brigade at Benares, made up the party, and, with Mr. Fogg, played whist by the hour together in absorbing silence.</p>

<p>As for Passepartout, he, too, had escaped sea-sickness, and took his meals conscientiously in the forward cabin.  He rather enjoyed the voyage, for he was well fed and well lodged, took a great interest in the scenes through which they were passing, and consoled himself with the delusion that his master's whim would end at Bombay.  He was pleased, on the day after leaving Suez, to find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walked and chatted on the quays.</p>

<p>"If I am not mistaken," said he, approaching this person, with his most amiable smile, "you are the gentleman who so kindly volunteered to guide me at Suez?"</p>

<p>"Ah!  I quite recognise you.  You are the servant of the strange Englishman&mdash;"</p>
